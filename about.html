            <h1><b><u>About Nigeria</u></b></h1>
            
            <h2><b><u>Geographical Overview</u></b></h2>
            <li><b>Location & Borders:</b> Nigeria is located in West Africa, bordered by Benin to the west, Niger to the north, Chad to the northeast, and Cameroon to the east. Its southern coast lies along the Gulf of Guinea, providing a gateway to maritime trade.</li>
            <li><b>Landscape & Climate:</b> The country boasts a diverse range of landscapes—from the arid Sahelian regions in the north to lush tropical rainforests and coastal plains in the south. Major rivers, notably the Niger and Benue, play a crucial role in the country's ecosystem and agriculture.</li>
            
            <h2><b><u>Historical Background</u></b></h2>
            <li><b>Ancient Civilizations:</b> Nigeria's history stretches back thousands of years. Ancient cultures, such as the Nok civilization, left behind remarkable terracotta sculptures and early evidence of iron smelting. Over the centuries, the region saw the rise of influential kingdoms and empires, including the Hausa city-states in the north, the Yoruba kingdoms in the southwest, and various Igbo communities in the southeast.</li>
            <li><b>Colonial Era & Independence:</b> In the 19th century, European colonial interests led to British control over the area, culminating in the formation of the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria. Nigeria gained its independence from Britain on October 1, 1960. Post-independence, the country has experienced a mix of military regimes and democratic governance, including the tumultuous period of the Nigerian Civil War (1967-1970).</li>

            <h2><b><u>Cultural Diversity</u></b></h2>
            <li><b>Ethnic Groups & Languages:</b> Nigeria is renowned for its cultural richness, with over 250 ethnic groups. The three largest are the Hausa-Fulani in the north, the Yoruba in the southwest, and the Igbo in the southeast. Although English is the official language—courtesy of its colonial past—hundreds of indigenous languages flourish, such as Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo.</li>
            <li><b>Arts, Music & Cinema:</b> Nigeria's creative expression is vibrant and influential. Nollywood, Nigeria's film industry, ranks among the largest in the world by volume, while its music scene has given rise to globally acclaimed genres like Afrobeat and Afropop. Traditional music, dance, and festivals further highlight the nation's rich cultural tapestry.</li>
        
            <h2><b><u>Economic Landscape</u></b></h2>
            <li><b>Natural Resources & Industries:</b> Often dubbed the "Giant of Africa," Nigeria boasts one of the continent’s largest economies. The nation is especially known for its oil and gas reserves, which have been pivotal in its economic development. However, Nigeria is also making strides in agriculture, telecommunications, banking, and entertainment.</li>
            <li><b>Entrepreneurship & Innovation:</b> With a young and dynamic population, Nigeria has seen a surge in entrepreneurial ventures and technological innovation, contributing to a growing start-up ecosystem across the country.</li>

            <h2><b><u>Political Structure & Governance</u></b></h2>
            <li><b>Federal System:</b> Nigeria operates as a federal republic, divided into 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (Abuja). This structure allows for a degree of state autonomy while maintaining national unity.</li>
            <li><b>Political Challenges & Progress:</b>Despite facing challenges such as corruption, regional conflicts, and infrastructural deficits, Nigeria has made strides in democratic governance. Ongoing efforts to enhance transparency and accountability continue to shape its political landscape.</li>
        
            <h2><b><u>Social & Developmental Aspects</u></b></h2>
            <li><b>Population & Demographics:</b> Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa, with an estimated population exceeding 200 million people. This youthful demographic presents both opportunities and challenges in education, employment, and social services.</li>
            <li><b>Education & Innovation:</b> Home to several reputable institutions such as the University of Ibadan and Obafemi Awolowo University, Nigeria is committed to advancing education and research. Its burgeoning tech industry is fostering innovation and driving economic diversification.</li>
        
            <h2><b><u>Tourism & International Relations</u></b></h2>
            <li><b>Tourism Highlights:</b>Nigeria offers a wealth of attractions—from the bustling urban center of Lagos with its dynamic nightlife and commerce to natural wonders like Zuma Rock, the scenic landscapes of the Jos Plateau, and the wildlife-rich Yankari National Park. Cultural festivals and historical sites further enrich the visitor experience.</li>
            <li><b>Diplomatic Engagements:</b>As a key player in West Africa, Nigeria is an active member of international organizations such as the African Union (AU), Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), and the United Nations (UN). Its diplomatic efforts are crucial in shaping regional trade, security, and cooperative development.</li>
